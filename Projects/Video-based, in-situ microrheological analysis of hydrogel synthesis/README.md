Hydrogels composed of silk fibroin and various crosslinking agents hold significant promise for biomedical
applications due to their tunable mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However, optimizing their
gelation characteristics remains a complex challenge. In this study, we integrate Multiple Particle Tracking
(MPT) and Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) to quantitatively characterize the gelation process of
silk-based hydrogels. Using polystyrene tracking beads and time-resolved microscopy, we monitored
transitions from fluid-like to elastic states. MPT analysis facilitated detailed trajectory reconstruction and
calculation of rheological parameters such as mean-square-displacement, viscosity, and moduli, yielding
a gelation time of 22–33 seconds. In parallel, DDM enabled automated, parameter-free extraction of
comparable rheological properties, with gelation times of 30–37 seconds. Both techniques captured the
critical crossover point where storage modulus surpasses loss modulus, corroborating the onset of
gelation. While MPT required careful parameter optimization and user oversight, DDM offered
streamlined data analysis. The resulting insights, together with machine learning-driven optimization
approaches, pave the way for more efficient hydrogel formulation design.
